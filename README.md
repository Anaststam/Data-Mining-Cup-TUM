## Data Mining Cup at Technical University of Munich 2018-2019

## The Dataset 

The Dataset used for the Cup was provided by Telefonica Germany. It contained information about outages in Telefonica's mobile telephony and data network in Germany. In the given time frame Telefonica's network consisted of approximately 60.000 Mobile Access network elements accross the technologies 2G, 3G and 4G. 

## The Task

Sometimes these network elements fail due to various reasons e.g Hardware failure, Fire, extreme weather,etc. While most of the failures happen without warning, Telefonica's experts believe that some unknown subset of the failures are preventable and would like us to predict possible outages in Telefonicaâ€™s mobile telephony and data network in the future. 

## Solution

Among other techniques, SMOTE algorithm was used in order to deal with the problem of imbalanced classes and Logistic Regression and Lasso as the classification model.
